# logy

An experimental Logitech/HID++ suite.

## `hidpp`

The `hidpp` crate implements the HID++ protocol used to communicate with Logitech devices.
It is primarily used for pairing and unpairing wireless devices and configuring their features.

It is currently in an experimental state and support for a lot of things is missing because I don't
have access to other devices than my Bolt receiver and MX Master 3S mouse to test things out with.

See [the README](/hidpp/README.md) for more information.
